About

The Football Ontology is a comprehensive knowledge representation framework designed to capture and organize essential information related to the world of football (soccer). This ontology aims to provide a structured and standardized way to model various entities and concepts within the football domain, including players, teams, leagues, matches, referees, coaches, and more. By leveraging Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and OWL, the Football Ontology facilitates data integration, interoperability, and advanced querying for football-related applications, including analytics, visualization, and decision support systems.
